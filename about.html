<div class="About">
  <h1>About Me!</h1>
  <p>My name is Amanda Mu’amoholeva, I graduated as a Nationally Certified Pharmacy Technician, and have been in the medical field for over 12 years, with this career I fully focused on patient care.
</p>
<p>While I absolutely loved advocating for our patients I quickly found myself getting frustrated with the Healthcare industry, once being all about patient centered care to a business making system. I wanted to take the skills I learned in the past 12 years and do something good with them. That's when I found UX design. The more I learned the more i fell in love, it was like UX design was made specifically for me! I would be able to show a passionate understanding with people who are trying to better themselves with their day to day lives and make products specifically made for them.</p>
<p>When i’m not chasing my dream in UX Design i’m either with my family enjoying being outside having BBQ’s get togethers, or you’ll see me and my husband knees deep in another remodeling project around our home. I enjoy playing any type of game from board games to card games, or you’ll find me in the kitchen trying new recipes. A typical winding down activity that I enjoy would be watching a movie with my husband in the comfort of our home, or just grabbing a book and getting cozy on the couch. </p>
